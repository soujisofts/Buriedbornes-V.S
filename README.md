#CBL Challenge - 2 {Library Foundation}

## Rewriting the Code:

I used a Foundation library to make an extension of the old code because it was giving some errors and I wanted to use some properties, namely:

“case”: to define options in an enumeration or paths in swift.

 “struct”: is a data type that groups properties and methods.

“mutating func”: allows methods in my structure to modify their properties.

“enum”: a data type to have unique limited and unique values.

The source I used was: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation

## How is the game?

Basically it's a game in the **Swift** language, inspired by the game **Buriedbornes - Hardcore RPG**, where you play on the **terminal** with actions controlled by numbers from **1 to 4**. The game involves turn-based combat, where the player (you) faces different enemies, defeats them and collects items such as **swords, armor** and others that can increase health, attack and dodge.

Furthermore, for every **5 enemies defeated**, a **mini-boss** appears and on the **20th enemy** defeated you face a **final boss**. To defeat these bosses, powerful items such as borrowed swords and dragon armor are obtained through 3 **mini-bosses**.

### For the game:

This game serves as a demonstration of a **turn-based combat RPG** with elements of progression and strategy. It tests the player's ability to **manage resources** (life and items), **choose strategic actions** and survive somewhat difficult combats.
